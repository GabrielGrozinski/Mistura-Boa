## Project Philosophy

All logic is organized into **hooks** and modular **services**, alongside the **main components**, ensuring separation between UI and data layers.  
This facilitates maintenance, readability and integration with new AI services or backends in the future.

## Details of the Start Screens (`src/components/Inicio`)

This folder contains the app's start screens, responsible for the user's entry experience:

- **PrimeiraTela**  
  Welcome screen, visually focused and presenting the app. It has no authentication logic, only UI.
  There is also a loading screen that runs throughout the app.

### First Screen
| Start | Loading |

## Details of Recipe Screens (`src/components/Telas_de_Receitas`)

This folder contains all recipe-related logic: categorization, filtering and the recipe screen itself.

- **App and User Recipes**  
  Recipes are separated into Carnivorous (app), Carnivorous (users), Vegan (app), Vegan (users), Vegetarian (app) and Vegetarian (users).
  There's also an indicator of the user's chosen diet type since registration.

### Main Recipes
| Carnivore | Vegetarian | Vegan |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| ![Carnivore](assets/README/tela_de_Receitas/tela1.jpg) | ![Vegetarian](assets/README/tela_de_Receitas/tela2.jpg) | ![Vegan](assets/README/tela_de_Receitas/tela3.jpg) |

---

- **Base Recipes**  
  There are 6 Base Recipe screens. Conceptually each would have its own recipes and dynamics, allowing special sections (e.g., holiday recipes or sea-themed recipes for a Poseidon character).

### Carnivore Base Recipe
| Base Recipe |
|-------------|
| ![BaseRecipe](assets/README/tela_de_Receitas/tela4.jpg) |

---

- **Carnivore, Vegan and Vegetarian Recipes**  
  All recipes are separated by carnivore, vegan and vegetarian.
  You can filter recipes by goals like lose weight, gain muscle; by difficulty, speed and calories.
  Filters can also be by Breakfast, Main Dish (lunch and dinner), Dessert and Drink.
  Filters are dynamic and work across recipes.
  Favoriting recipes is supported.

- **Recipe**  
  The recipe screen has many mechanics.
  From top to bottom: recipe image, title, author, preparation time and rating.
  Then ingredients and steps.
  Below steps there is a timer (with the recipe's time) that the user can use; it can be paused.
  At the bottom are comments and ratings, plus a button to mark the recipe as completed.
  Comments are available only to users with at least Bronze rank.
  Users can rate or comment and rate the recipe.

## Monetization

Since this is a portfolio app, it wasn't monetized, but here are some ideas to monetize it.

- **Ads:** simple and practical but may give an unprofessional impression. In this app, ads could be carefully integrated‚Äîfor example, in the AI recipe generator: when the user clicks to generate a recipe, show an ad while the AI takes a few seconds to generate the recipe.
- **Subscription:** common and practical. The Poseidon character could be subscription-only. Subscriptions could offer benefits: more XP, more recipes created per day, exclusive recipes for subscribers, characters, seasonal passes, more generator characters and featured placement for created recipes.

Overall, I tried to adapt live-service product logic. The idea is to keep the user engaged by creating objectives and rewards. The user is motivated to log in daily for prizes; to create difficult recipes for rewards; to earn XP to unlock characters. Monetization focuses on subscriptions and microtransactions (e.g., purchasable characters). Balance is necessary so subscribers feel advantaged while non-subscribers aren‚Äôt frustrated.

---

## Extra Features

Below are some features not in the app but that could be added. They show my vision for improving and monetizing the app.

### Loading

The app has a loading screen used across the app.
Originally the loading screen has a single image variation (truck moving) and different text variations.
It‚Äôs possible to create exclusive loading screens (e.g., a Poseidon loading screen that appears only when using Poseidon).

| Poseidon | Santa | Ghost |
|----------|-------|-------|
| ![Poseidon](assets/README/readmePrincipal/carregamento2.png) | ![Santa](assets/README/readmePrincipal/carregamento3.png) | ![Ghost](assets/README/readmePrincipal/carregamento4.png) |

---

### Events

Events drive engagement. In MisturaBoa, events could highlight specific recipes like spicy recipes, 24-hour recipes, best recipes of the year, etc.

| Events |
|--------|
| ![Events](assets/README/readmePrincipal/eventos.png) |

---

### Festive Recipes

Holiday recipes could boost app activity during Christmas, Halloween, Easter and other times, increasing users and potential subscribers.

| Halloween & Christmas |
|-----------------------|
| ![Holidays](assets/README/readmePrincipal/receitasDestacadas.png) |

---

### Exclusive Recipes

Exclusive recipes increase user interest. Each character (especially hard-to-unlock ones) could have exclusive recipes, and some characters could be subscription-only or purchasable.

| Poseidon & Dragon |
|-------------------|
| ![Exclusive](assets/README/readmePrincipal/receitasExclusivas.png) |

---

### Legendary Recipes

A special "Book" with "Legendary Recipes" could exist. Recipes could be selected via monthly/yearly events and top-rated recipes included. Subscribers might be allowed more entries into competitions.

| Legendary Recipes |
|-------------------|
| ![Legendary](assets/README/readmePrincipal/receitasLendarias.png) |

---

### Ranking System

The ranking system is implemented, but rewards could be expanded.
Examples:
- **Gold:** can create and generate one extra recipe per day.
- **Diamond:** 1.5x XP gain.
- **Emerald:** recipes get highlighted.
- **Supreme Chef:** unlocks exclusive recipes and characters.

| NoRank | Bronze |
|--------|--------|
| ![NoRank](assets/README/ranking/noRank.png) | ![Bronze](assets/README/ranking/bronze.png) |

| Gold | Diamond |
|------|---------|
| ![Gold](assets/README/ranking/ouro.png) | ![Diamond](assets/README/ranking/diamante.png) |

| Emerald | Supreme Chef |
|---------|--------------|
| ![Emerald](assets/README/ranking/esmeralda.png) | ![SupremeChef](assets/README/ranking/chefeSupremo.png) |

---

### Challenge/Recipe Tree

A challenge tree like Duolingo could be added where users complete specific recipes (historical or iconic recipes) leading to a final recipe. This increases engagement and gives progression.

| Duolingo Tree | Recipe Tree Example |
|---------------|---------------------|
| ![DuolingoTree](assets/README/readmePrincipal/arvoreDeReceitas.jpg) | ![RecipeTree](assets/README/readmePrincipal/arvoreDeReceitasExemplo.png) |

---

### Cooking Courses

Cooking courses would be a great addition for subscribers, improving recipe quality and increasing revenue.

---

### Energy System

An energy system limits how much users can use features each day, encouraging return visits and monetization (e.g., subscriptions to increase energy).
This mechanic could apply to creation/generation of recipes, completing recipes, and many other features.

| Energy System Example |
|-----------------------|
| ![EnergyExample](assets/README/readmePrincipal/energia.jpg) |
